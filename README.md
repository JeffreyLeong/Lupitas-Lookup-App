# Lupitas Lookup App
 CIS-024

What to do
Your awesome friend Lupita just had an amazing birthday party!  Lupita has a huge Instagram following with 1000 friends!   You were lucky enough to be invited to her exclusive family and friends birthday party.  During her party she asked you to write an app to help her keep track of all of her friends birthdays. 

Write a program that uses a dictionary to store students birthdays.  Your program should ask the user what their name is, and look it up in the dictionary .  If their birthday is in the dictionary, it should print their birthday.  If their birthday is not in the dictionary, it should print that the birthday is unknown.

An advanced solution will take a partial name, like “Rod”, and print all the birthdays for all of Lupita’s friends that contain the substring “Rod”.  A simple solution will take a full name and print the birthday.  Both advanced and simple solutions will earn full points.
